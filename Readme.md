---

## Dataset (Hypothetical)  
You will find the dataset inside the **`data`** folder.  
It contains a **time series dataset of turbidity (NTU)** measured between **2017–2025** near seagrass meadows in a hypothetical industrial embayment.

## What to Deliver  

- **Plots & Analysis**: At least one clear figure with commentary (subplots welcome).  
- **Insights**: A few bullet points summarising the story you see in the data.  
- **Limitations & Recommendations**:
	- Identify gaps in the data (missing or irregular values).
	- Suggest what additional variables would help to better explain the relationship between turbidity and seagrass health.  

Please email your work **one day before the 2nd round of the interview** as:  

- **Script** - A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`), R Markdown (`.Rmd`), or MATLAB script (`.m`)  
- **Short Summary** - a 1-page summary (Word doc, PDF, or Markdown file) including your findings and plot(s).
